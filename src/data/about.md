I'm a 17 year old from Toronto making the most out of my short time here on Earth. I'm driven to solve problems and maximize my impact on the world, whether that be through reducing maternal mortality in Bolivia or enabling electricity in rural Africa. You can usually find me in front of my laptop figuring out a new concept or engrossed in a good read.
